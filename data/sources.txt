I understand, but my colleague explained yesterday that we have to be in touch with the warehouse, this has been done for you - so we are awaiting the reply.
As soon as we have the information, we can then let you know the whereabouts of your order
The item was due to dispatch 18.12
Thank you - so this query is with warehouse as stated in yesterdays chat, we have to await the reply to the investigation.
As soon as we have heard back, tis is when you will be emailed
Regrettably the prices of the items are as they show online, we cannot change or reduce this for you
The lead times are as advertised on the website.
As we do not carry stock then all items are made to order, shipped on to us here at #URL# and then sent onto yourselves.
That is why we ask that you allow these lead times please.
The lead time showing is when the next batch is due to arrive.
